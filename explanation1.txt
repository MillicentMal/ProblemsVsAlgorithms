The square root function makes use of the binary search algorithm. 
The number given is cut in half, and then the result is squared. 
If this result is greater than the number, then the upper bound becomes 
the half that was squared before - 1. Then this is added to a start and 
halved again. 
This process leads to a time complexity of O(log(n)).
